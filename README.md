# q-kdb-sublime-syntax
q/kdb syntax highlighting

* Includes formats for q/kdb 3.x, 2.x, k, and q output 
* can be used with Sublime Text 3, other editors, github, etc

## Details
This version stays largely faithful to the current [sublime-q](https://github.com/komsit37/sublime-q) syntax highlighting by [kimtang](https://github.com/kimtang/sublime-q), with updates and fixes:

* Properly handles escape characters in strings (including unicode)
* Correctly interprets comments and block comments
* Updated list of reserved words 
* Still uses the reversed function definition/function argument highlighting that you know and love
* Does **not** highlight all your parentheses anymore
* Highlight '::' (view/global assign) like ':' (assign)
* And more!
